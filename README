This application runs from the command line with a numeric argument
supplied by the user. At this time the application does not support
text, commas, decimals or negative numbers. It also will only work for
numbers less than ten digits long.

I realize the spec file desperately needs to be DRYed up. Also I need
to write specs that test that the proper error message for incorrect
input displays when something other than an integer is input. I would
like to handle these cases better rather than just displaying a message,
and hope to do that in the future.
